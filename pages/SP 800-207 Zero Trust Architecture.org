** All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
** All communication is secured regardless of network location.
** Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
** Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy—including the observable state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset—and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes.
** The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets.
** All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
** The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.

** The entire enterprise private network is not considered an implicit trust zone.
** Devices on the network may not be owned or configurable by the enterprise.
** No resource is inherently trusted.
** Not all enterprise resources are on enterprise-owned infrastructure.
** Remote enterprise subjects and assets cannot fully trust their local network connection.
** Assets and workflows moving between enterprise and nonenterprise infrastructure should have a consistent security policy and posture.

*** variation of the device agent/gateway model above
*** the entire private cloud is located behind a gateway
*** useful for enterprises that have legacy applications or on-premises data centers that cannot have individual gateways in place

*** ((63ba1d4d-838b-40ff-a0b3-79c3ffff832f))
*** primary benefit of this model over the others is that a software component does not need to be installed on all client devices
** ((63ba1d87-7fed-4de4-b54f-d02a2c484de0))
*** PEP could be an enterprise local service or a cloud service in this model
*** main advantage of this model variant is that individual applications are segmented from the rest of the asset
*** One of the disadvantages of this model is that enterprises must maintain these sandboxed applications for all assets and may not have full visibility into client assets
