*
* Frequency of Sensitive APIs: malwares usually ask for more permissions than needed, and use them to obtain and upload sensitive information frequently. For example, a video app usually doesn't need to know who are in the user's contacts. Accordingly, the frequency of using sensitive APIs will be different between malicious and benign apps. Thus, we use the frequency of sensitive APIs as one feature.

* This paper focuses on the two kinds of threats in iOS system. Abuse of security-critical Private APIs and stealing (uploading without notifying the user) privacy data in devices. Here, we take i4Tools and Youmi SDK [11] for example to explain how DMIA resist the two threats and demonstrate the effectiveness of DMIA again.
