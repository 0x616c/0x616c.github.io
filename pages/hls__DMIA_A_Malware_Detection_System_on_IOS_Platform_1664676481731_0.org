*
* Frequency of Sensitive APIs: malwares usually ask for more permissions than needed, and use them to obtain and upload sensitive information frequently. For example, a video app usually doesn't need to know who are in the user's contacts. Accordingly, the frequency of using sensitive APIs will be different between malicious and benign apps. Thus, we use the frequency of sensitive APIs as one feature.

* In summary, a behaviour (e.g. URL request, address request) is defined as controllable behaviour only when it is just after a user interaction event.

* This paper focuses on the two kinds of threats in iOS system. Abuse of security-critical Private APIs and stealing (uploading without notifying the user) privacy data in devices. Here, we take i4Tools and Youmi SDK [11] for example to explain how DMIA resist the two threats and demonstrate the effectiveness of DMIA again.

* SecLab's PiOS [5] can detecting privacy leak of app. It creates hierarchical structure of class from binary file and build CFG. Analysing data stream to judge that weather privacy information transform from origin to leak point. This is a kind of static analysis. There are several shortcomings of PiOS such high false positive.

* Andreas Kurtz introduces DIOS, which is an iOS privacy leak analysis model based on dynamic API call sequence [7]. DIOS mainly includes three parts: Backend is used as the central data storage, worker is data interactive link between backend and iOS device and client is used for analysing the behaviour of the iOS App.
