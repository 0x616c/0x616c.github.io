* Hello, fellow netizen. Welcome to my home on the Internet.

For a long time, I admired those who commit to [[https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public][learn in public.]] It is now time to do my part. So welcome to the current iteration of this website. At this time, I am using an data export [[https://logseq.com][from the wonderful Logseq application]] as I use it day to day. I will include quick blogs post, long-form essays, and notes about the former and all matter of things as I write them. I will try to label and organize information over time as my brain and Logseq intends: as part of a large graph.

So thanks for visiting. Have questions comments, or concerns? That's great, feel free to
