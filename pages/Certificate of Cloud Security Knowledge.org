*** Understand the differences between cloud computing and traditional infrastructure or virtualization, and how abstraction and automation impact security.
*** Become familiar with the NIST model for cloud computing and the CSA reference architecture.
*** Use tools such as the CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) to evaluate and compare cloud providers.
*** Cloud providers should clearly document their security controls and features and publish them using tools like the CSA CAIQ.
*** Use tools like the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix to assess and document cloud project security and compliance requirements and controls, as well as who is responsible for each.
*** Use a cloud security process model to select providers, design architectures, identify control gaps, and implement security and compliance controls.

**** There is less physical control over assets and their controls and processes. You don’t physically control the infrastructure or the provider’s internal processes.
**** There is a greater reliance on contracts, audits, and assessments, as you lack day-to-day visibility or management.
**** This creates an increased requirement for proactive management of relationship and adherence to contracts, which extends beyond the initial contract signing and audits. Cloud providers also constantly evolve their products and services to remain competitive and these ongoing innovations might exceed, strain, or not be covered by existing agreements and assessments.
**** Cloud customers have a reduced need (and associated reduction in costs) to manage risks that the cloud provider accepts under the shared responsibility model. You haven’t outsourced accountability for managing the risk, but you can certainly outsource the management of some risks.
*** ((63a2a202-5b49-42a5-9dbc-79fb500d399c))
**** Request or acquire documentation.
**** Review their security program and documentation.
**** Review any legal, regulatory, contractual, and jurisdictional requirements for both the provider and yourself. (See the Domain 3: Legal for more.)
**** Evaluate the contracted service in the context of your information assets.
**** Separately evaluate the overall provider, such as finances/stability, reputation, and outsourcers.
*** ((63a2a23e-a885-460f-bc1a-0bf868508b55))
**** Identify shared responsibilities
**** Understand how a contract affects your governance framework/model
**** Develop a process for cloud provider assessments
**** Rely on easy access to dcs and reports needed by cloud prospects for assessments (e.g. CSA STAR registrants)
**** Align risk requirements to assets involved
**** Create specific risk management, acceptance, and mitigation methodologies
**** Use controls to manage residual risk
**** Use tool to track approved providers based on asset type
