* SDP is an advanced implementation of Zero Trust with the following network capabilities:
** Separating the control plane where trust is established from the data plane where actual data is transferred.
** Hiding the infrastructure (e.g. blackening the servers) using a dynamic deny-all firewall (not deny-all, allow exceptions) - the point where all unauthorized packets are dropped for logging and analyzing traffic.
** Using single packet authorization to authenticate and authorize users and validate devices for access to protected services - least privilege is implicit in this protocol.
