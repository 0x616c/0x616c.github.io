* ade secrets are knowledge which is: secret, derives value from its secrecy and is reasonably protected. Trade secrets can be extremely valuable(Reid, Searle, & Vishnubhakat, 2014) and are a strategic tool for innovative firms (Arora, Athreye, & Huang, 2016; Crass, Garcia Valero, Pitton, & Rammer, 2019). The secrecy of these intellectual assets means little is known about their use in practice.

* Civil litigation generally involves the trade secret owner pursuing misappropriation by a third party. This litigation is increasing 14% annually in the US (Elmore, 2016); UK courts have expressed concern about the rising use of confidentiality (of which trade secrets are a subset) claims to shield documents in IP proceedings (Roth, 2019).

* Event studies find that, despite the high costs and risks to both parties, the plaintiff (patent owner) enjoys positive returns and the defendant (alleged infringer) negative. In the IT industry, the defendant suffers an abnormal return of -2.66% and the plaintiff enjoys a return of 2.55% (Raghu, Woo, Mohan, & Rao, 2008).

* The resolution of a case, in which the uncertainty around the validity of a patent is resolved, conveys a 1.0% positive abnormal return (Marco, 2011). However, other work finds a lack of statistically significant returns, suggests patent litigation abnormal returns may be short-lived and that the impact of such disputes is fading (Sidak & Skog, 2015); this is in line with trends in cyber-breaches discussed later.

* There is a complementary explanation for the muted response of markets to cyberbreaches.(Odlyzko, 2019) argues that ‘cybersecurity is not that important.’ Comparing the impact of breaches to other disruptions such as natural disasters and military actions, he notes the impact of cyberbreaches pales in comparison.

* Further, the risk adjustments do not make substantial differences to the CAARs at any event window. For example, for the 21 day event window (t-10, t+10) this has the lowest CAAR of -0.49% for the 5 factor model. Even here the announcement of something as potentially serious as a trade secret breach on average leads to a fall of less than half of one percent in firm value.

* As a benchmark, patent litigation that reaches US district civil courts had a success rate of 33% from1997-2016 (PWC, 2017). In the 214 cases (1996-2020) in our total database, 60% of cases have at least one defendant who plead guilty. Criminal cases also require less firm resources than civil, as they are not responsible for legal fees.

While we would have expected the involvement of foreign agents to have a larger impact than domestic events, the domestic threat is equally as important.
